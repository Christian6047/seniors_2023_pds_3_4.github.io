<!-- <p><b>HicksLaw</b>
describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices
For example if you need to mow the lawn, and take out the trash, what will you do first? This can affect your time to make a decision.
I have this in my adventure game senior project
<b>Fitts Law</b>
the time to move to a target depends on how big it is and on how far away it is
For example, if you need to push a car in front of you 1 mile forward, it will take longer than getting a handball a mile away from you and moving it 2 miles forward.
This is present with the size of my buttons throughout my webpage, as some are bigger than others and further apart, affecting the time it takes to click on them.
<b>Function -v- Feature</b>
‚ÄçA feature function is a function that computes one or more feature values from input data. 
Like an if else statement based on users input
I have these on almost all my projects for senior year, like append values
<b>Visual Hierarchy</b>
the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance
Like an organized or unorganized list
I also have this in append values
<b>Responsive -v- Adaptive Design</b>
Responsive is The device or browser window dictates the way a single layout displays. The UX design adapts to Chrome, Bing, Firefox, and Safari and to Windows, macOS, Linux, or other operating systems
Adaptive design is The client's device or browser predetermines which layout to populate.
An example of this is this very own HTML, see how it automatically fits in your screen? And its all colored with features.
